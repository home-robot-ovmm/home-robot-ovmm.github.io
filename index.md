Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation (OVMM) is a core challenge for robotics research because it involves bringing together four key capabilities: perception, language understanding, navigation, and manipulation, all of which will be necessary for robots to be useful assistants in human environments. OVMM is a foundational challenge for generally useful robots precisely because it requires tackling and integrating all of these components. To drive research in this area, we introduce the HomeRobot OVMM challenge, where an agent navigates household environments to grasp novel objects and place them on target receptacles. HomeRobot has two components: a simulation component, which uses a large and diverse curated object set in new, high-quality multi-room home environments; and a real-world component, where we provide a software stack for the low-cost Hello Robot Stretch to encourage duplication of real-world experiments across labs. We implement both a reinforcement learning and a
heuristic (model-based) baseline and show evidence of sim-to-real transfer.
